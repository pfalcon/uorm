uorm is very lightweight "Anti-ORM" style ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
for Pycopy (https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy), a small Python
implementation.

uorm doesn't try to define obscure API to conceal SQL from a programmer,
it's sole purpose is to provide very thin "model" abstraction just to
keep code organized, and automate the most repeative, trivial SQL
queries. More complex queries, you will write in full SQL as usual, so
you will know what exactly is executed, will be able to easily optimize
it, etc.

See examples/ directory for usage examples.
